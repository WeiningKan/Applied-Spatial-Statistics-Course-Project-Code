# Applied-Spatial-Statistics: Project Code
### [Examining the effects of Socioeconomic development on PM2.5 in United States](https://github.com/WeiningKan/Applied-Spatial-Statistics-Course-Project-Code/blob/main/Final_Project_WeiningKan.ipynb)
This study provides important insights into the role of socioeconomic and physical factors in shaping the spatial distribution of PM2.5 levels across the United States. By employing a multi-level model that integrates data, we have been able to identify key factors that significantly contribute to PM2.5 variations.
